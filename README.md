# interpolation_theorem_for_classical_propositional_logic


Theorem. Let A and B be formulas of P , such that (1) they share at least one propositional symbol in com- mon, and (2) îP A ⊃ B. For any two such formulas of P, there exists a formula C (called the P-interpolant of the formulas A and B) such that (3) îP A ⊃ C, (4) îP C ⊃ B, and (5) C contains only propositional symbols that occur in both A and B (i.e., only propositional symbols shared by A and B).
